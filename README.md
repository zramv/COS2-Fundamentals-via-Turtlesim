# COS2 Fundamentals via Turtlesim

# Node
### Concept:
A **node** is an executable program, and each node has a specific responsibility to fulfill. Multiple nodes work together to build a robotic system.

### Task: Control the Turtle with the Keyboard

- **Start the first node (turtlesim_node):** This launches a node that shows a turtle in a window:

      ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node 
- **Start the second node (turtle_teleop_key):** This node allows the user to move the turtle with their keyboard:

      ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
- This command is used to check the run nodes:

      ros2 node list
- This command is used to show information about the /turtlesim node:

      ros2 node info /turtlesim
### Result:
- **turtlesim_node:** draws the turtle.
- **teleop_turtle:** moves the turtle.

# Parameter 
### Concept:
**Parameters** are settings for a node, they can be changed at runtime without modifying the code. Think of them as "configuration values"(like background color, robot speed limits, etc).

### Task: Change The Background Color to Green
- Check available parameters of turtlesim:
  
      ros2 param list
- Get the value of the green color:

      ros2 param get /turtlesim background_g
- Change a parameter value for green and blue color:

      ros2 param set /turtlesim bacground_g 255
      ros2 param set /turtlesim bacground_b 0
### Result:
- Change the background to **green**.

# topic
### Concept:
A **Topic** is a communication channel in ROS2 where one node publishes data and another subscribes to it.  
It is used for **Topic** is a communication like sensor readings or robot positions.  

You can imagine it like: 
- One person(node) **talks(publishes)**.
- Others(nodes) can **choose to listen(subscribe)**.
- If nobody listens, the message is still spoken but ignored.

<br>

### Task: Subscribe to the Turtle's Pose Topic

- Check available topics:

      ros2 topic list
- Subscribe to the Topic /turtle1/pose:

      ros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose
- Move the turtle with the keyboard.

### Result: 
- **Publisher**: turtlesim_node (talks, sending pose updates).
- **Subscribe**: your terminal (ros2 topic echo, listens to the updates).

# service 
### Concept:
A **Service** is a way for nodes to communicate with a request â†’ response pattern.  
- One node acts as a Server (offers the service).  
- Another node acts as a Client (asks for something).  
- The server does not keep sending data like a topic; it only responds when requested.

</p> 
<br>

### Task: Call the Clear Service to Erase the Turtle path
- Check available service:

      ros2 service list
- Check the type of /clear service (check for know if it needs to input data):

      ros2 service type /clear
- Call the service to clear the turtle trail:

      ros2 service call /reset std_srvs/srv/Empty

### Result:
**Server**: turtlesim_node(offers the /clear servers).<br>
**Client**: Your terminal(requested to clear).
